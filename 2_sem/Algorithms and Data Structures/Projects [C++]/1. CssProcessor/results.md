The most difficult task in this project was to prevent every type of input mismatches. There were some tricks in test input data that were supposed to make our program fail. Examples of those were eg. weird naming of css elements, weird structure of css document etc. It was difficult because at the start we had access only to first 3 tests. The input data of all other tests were hidden and it was "blind" search for the bugs and tricks. We had access only to program that evaluated our scripts with all of the tests and gave the pass/not pass result.
