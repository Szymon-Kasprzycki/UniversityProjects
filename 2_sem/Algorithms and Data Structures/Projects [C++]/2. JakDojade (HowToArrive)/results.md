I was one of only few people that managed to pass all of the tests. Only 5 of 75 people managed to achieve appropriate results in highly efficient manner.

Every test had its own time and memory limit that were set up strictly.

Few last test were possible to pass only by usage of the hashmap and (nearly) O(1) time of memory access. Without that, it was not possible to process the data and not exceed the time limit.
