# 2D Virtual World Simulator

**Author:** Szymon Kasprzycki, _Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology_

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a 2D virtual world simulator in Python, where organisms interact within a two-dimensional grid. The simulator includes various species of animals and plants, each with unique behaviors, and allows player control over a human character. The simulation operates in turns, with organisms performing actions based on their characteristics and interactions with other organisms.

## Features

- **Grid Structure:** The virtual world is represented by a two-dimensional grid, with each cell capable of holding only one organism.
- **Organism Behavior:** Organisms perform actions during each turn, including movement, multiplication, and interactions with other organisms.
- **Collision Resolution:** In case of a collision between organisms, the outcome is determined based on factors such as strength, initiative, and species-specific behavior.
- **Human Player:** The simulation includes a human player as a specific type of animal, allowing player-controlled movement and special abilities activation.
- **Message Display:** The GUI interface includes components for displaying messages about events occurring within the simulated world.
- **Saving and Loading:** Implementation of functionality to save and load the game state to and from files.

## Implementation features

- **World Management:** Implement a class named "World" responsible for managing gameplay and organism life cycles, including methods for turn processing and world visualization.
- **Organism Hierarchy:** Define an abstract class named "Organism" as the base class for animals and plants, with common attributes and methods such as strength, initiative, position, and actions.
- **Animal Behavior:** Implement common behaviors for all animals in the "Animal" class, including default movement and multiplication.
- **Human Class:** Extend the "Animal" class to create the "Human" class, allowing player-controlled movement and special ability activation.
- **Species-Specific Classes:** Implement subclasses of animals and plants, each with unique characteristics and behaviors defined by strength, initiative, and actions.
- **World Interaction:** Implement mechanisms for organisms to affect the world state, such as spawning new organisms or modifying existing ones.
- **GUI Interface:** Create a graphical user interface using a Python GUI library (e.g., Tkinter) with components for visualizing the virtual world and displaying events.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

- **World:** Manages the gameplay and life cycles of organisms.
- **Organism:** Abstract class serving as the base for animals and plants.
- **Animal:** Class implementing common behaviors for all animals.
- **Human:** Subclass of Animal representing the player-controlled character.
- **Species-Specific Classes:** Subclasses of animals and plants with unique behaviors.
- **GUI Interface:** Components for visualizing the virtual world and displaying events.

## Project Grading

- **3 Points:** Implementation of world management, organism behavior, human control, and GUI interface.
- **4 Points:** Addition of breeding for animals, planting for plants, implementation of human special ability, and saving/loading game state.
- **5 Points:** Implementation of additional features such as adding organisms via mouse click and support for different grid structures.
