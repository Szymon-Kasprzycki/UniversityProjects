            <h2 class="section-title">Object of the game</h2>
            <p>The game of tennis played on a rectangular court with a net running across the centre. The aim is to hitthe ball over the net landing the ball within the margins of the court and in a way that results in your opponent being unable to return the ball. You win a point every time your opponent is unable to return the ball within the court.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Players and Equipment</h2>
            <p>A tennis match can be played by either one player on each side – a singles match – or two players on each side – a doubles match. The rectangular shaped court has a base line (at the back), service areas (two spaces just over the net in which a successful serve must land in) and two tram lines down either side. A singles match will mean you use the inner side tram line and a doubles match will mean you use the outer tram line.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A court can be played on four main surfaces including grass, clay, hard surface and carpet. Each
                tournament will choose one surface type and stick without throughout. All that is required in terms of
                equipment is a stringed racket each and a tennis ball.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Scoring</h2>
            <p>You need to score four points to win a game of tennis. The points are known as 15 (1 point), 30 (two points), 40 (three points) and the fourth would result in the winning point and the end of that game. If the scores went to 40-40 this would be known as deuce. When a game reaches deuce the player must then win by two clear points.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Winning the Game</h2>
            <p>To win the game you must win a certain amount of sets (best of three for women’s matches and best of 5 sets for men’s matches). Winning a set is simply the first player to reach 6 games but have to be clear by at least 2 games. If your opponent wins 5 games you must win the set 7-5. If the set goes to 6-6 then a tie break is played and it’s simply the first player to 7 points.</p>

        <section class="rule" id="serving">
            <h2 class="section-title">Serving</h2>
            <p>A tennis match begins with the umpire doing a coin toss. The player who wins the toss can choose to serve, receive or pick the side from which they want to start the match.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The serving player has to stand behind the baseline of his side of the tennis <a href="#object-of-the-game">court</a> and within the bounds of the centre mark and the sideline. For a successful serve, the server has to toss the ball up with his non-playing hand and hit it with the racket before it bounces. The ball needs to cross the net and land within the serving area which is marked on the diagonally opposite side of the court for it to be deemed a legal serve.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each player is allowed two serves per point. If a player hits the net, or the ball’s first bounce occurs outside the serving area, it's called a service fault and the server has a second serve to initiate the point. If the server’s foot touches the baseline or goes out of bounds of the sideline, it is known as a foot fault and the server will have a second serve. If a player commits a fault on his second serve also, it is called a double fault and the receiving player gets that point.</p>
